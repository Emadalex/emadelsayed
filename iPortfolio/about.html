              About Me

I am Emad Elsayed, a dedicated and highly experienced Health and Safety Professional with a profound commitment to promoting safety and improving the wellbeing of individuals in various industrial settings. My journey in the realm of occupational safety and health has spanned over two decades, marked by an unwavering passion for ensuring that every worker returns home safely at the end of the day.</p>

<p><b>My initial step</b> into this dynamic profession was as a Safety Helper, where I first witnessed the crucial importance of safety practices on a construction site. This experience ignited a fire within me, driving me to pursue a career dedicated to the welfare of workers and the prevention of workplace incidents.</p>

<p>My career progression has been nothing short of remarkable. From those early days as a Safety Helper, I consistently dedicated myself to self-improvement, safety education, and a deep understanding of industry-specific safety standards. This commitment led me to rise through the ranks to become an accomplished Health and Safety Professional.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on a variety of high-profile and complex projects in the Middle East, focusing primarily on Oil and Gas Field construction projects. These projects have not only allowed me to expand my knowledge but have also provided a platform to make a tangible impact on safety performance and culture. I am incredibly proud of the seven projects I've been involved in, each of which has contributed to a culture of safety excellence, remarkable safety milestones, and substantial cost savings.</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of my professional journey has been my association with prestigious organizations like Saudi Aramco and SNC Lavalin Fayez Engineering. During my tenure as a Saudi Aramco PMT HSE Lead, I led the Safety Team with a profound sense of responsibility. This role allowed me to collaborate closely with SA operation and Contractor Management teams, ensuring a cohesive safety approach. My strong technical proficiency in Construction Safety, coupled with an in-depth understanding of international standards for HSE and Risk management, enabled me to make a significant impact.

My commitment extends beyond technical expertise; I've consistently demonstrated a high degree of leadership, integrity, and interpersonal skills. I believe that fostering a strong and inclusive safety culture is essential.</p>

<p>My emphasis on employee involvement, team building, diversity, and inclusion has played a pivotal role in achieving outstanding EH&S performance.

The development of an EH&S (Environment, Health, and Safety) culture is a priority for me. Empowering the workforce to consistently deliver outstanding EH&S performance is not just a professional objective but a personal commitment. I'm driven by the desire to see everyone on a project site work in a safe and healthy environment. I find great satisfaction in knowing that my efforts contribute to the wellbeing of countless individuals.</p>

<p>Moreover, I've not just focused on ensuring safety on the job site; I've actively engaged with contractors, subcontractors, inspectors, and various stakeholders to maintain a professional and respectful approach. This collaborative mindset has been instrumental in driving the Project Safety Culture forward.

Transitioning to my role as a Principal Safety Advisor at Petrofac Emirates, I took on the responsibility of overseeing HSSE activities in designated areas. This included the application of hazard identification and risk assessment processes and the implementation of control measures to mitigate risks. I have always believed in participating in the review of the effectiveness of hazard controls and engaging in the HSSE lessons learned forum.</p>

<P>         My commitment to safety extended to my role as an HSE Superintendent with TECNICAS REUNIDAS (TR). During my tenure, I assisted the HSE Manager in various duties, including risk analysis, JSA, and program implementation. I also played a significant role in designing training materials and site safety signs, contributing to the enhancement of safety awareness and practices. Ensuring compliance with safety regulations and standards was paramount. Conducting inspections, issuing work permits, and taking immediate action in situations of imminent danger or repeated safety deficiencies were part of my daily responsibilities.

My multifaceted experience includes my role as an HSE Supervisor with TECHINT CIMI.MONTUBI. Here, I planned, scheduled, and conducted a wide range of training programs. From orientation to specialized training in safety areas such as Confined Space, Safety Cranes, and Fall Protection, my aim was to ensure comprehensive safety awareness and preparedness. I actively contributed to the development of training materials tailored to address specific site inspection findings and unsafe conditions, enhancing the effectiveness of safety training programs. Providing guidance and instruction in critical safety areas like Risk Assessments, Job Hazard Analysis (JHA), and Welding was part of my daily commitment.</p>

<p>My journey has also included roles as an HSE Manager and Safety Officer with Orascom Construction Industries. In these roles, I managed the implementation and continuous monitoring of HSE programs. I provided expertise in OSHA and industrial hygiene standards, conducted regular inspections of jobsites, oversaw the review of medical treatment orders, and collaborated with project managers and safety supervisors in all phases of HSE. My commitment to safety was unwavering, and I played a pivotal role in accident investigations, prepared reports, and initiated corrective actions, contributing to a proactive safety culture and incident resolution.

While my career highlights have focused on my professional life, I've never ceased to learn and improve.</p>

<p>My education and certifications stand as a testament to my commitment to excellence. I hold the prestigious Chartered Membership of the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (CMIOSH) and have achieved numerous safety certifications and qualifications, including the NEBOSH International General Certificate (IGC), IOSH Train The Trainer Certificate, and OSHA certified course for construction from the USA Department of Labor, among others. These qualifications reflect my dedication to staying at the forefront of safety knowledge and practices.</p>

<p>In addition to my professional achievements, I am committed to self-improvement. As my career has unfolded, I've expanded my horizons by delving into the world of Computer Programming and AI. This journey into the technology sphere ensures that I remain well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

My command of languages is an asset in my professional life. I am fluent in Arabic and proficient in English, enabling effective communication with diverse teams and stakeholders. 

<p>My technical skills include proficiency in Microsoft Office applications, while my front-end web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are testament to my versatility.

As I look to the future, my commitment to safety and my dedication to improvement remain as strong as ever. I am excited by the potential of emerging technologies and their role in reshaping the safety landscape. It is my goal to not only keep pace with these changes but to lead in embracing innovative approaches to safety.</p>

<p>In summary, my journey as a Health and Safety Professional has been marked by a relentless pursuit of excellence, a commitment to safety, and a dedication to the welfare of individuals working in challenging environments. I am proud of my achievements and the impact I've had on safety cultures and practices. My journey has been a testament to the value of unwavering dedication, continuous self-improvement, and a passion for ensuring that every worker returns home safely. I am confident that my experiences, knowledge, and commitment make me an invaluable asset to any project or organization, and I am excited to embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.
