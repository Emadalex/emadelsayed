            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a seasoned Health and Safety Professional with an impressive 22-year track record specializing in HSE consultancy for Oil and Gas Field construction projects within the Middle East. Having successfully seen through the completion of 7 projects, from their initial construction phase to seamless start-up and operation, I have consistently achieved remarkable safety milestones, significant cost savings, and fostered a culture of improved safety practices on these projects. My commitment to safety is underpinned by my prestigious Chartered Membership with the Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (CMIOSH) and my status as an approved IOSH training provider, reinforced by multiple safety certifications.
                My journey in this field started humbly as a safety helper, and through unwavering dedication and continuous self-improvement, I have ascended to the role of HSE manager. I take immense pride in my accomplishments on every project I have contributed to, consistently earning recognition and appreciation from project management. I am confident in my ability to secure recommendations from these project managements, and I am pleased to make their names available as references if required.
                Furthermore, my commitment to self-improvement remains unwavering, as I am currently broadening my knowledge in Computer Programming and AI, ensuring that I am well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
